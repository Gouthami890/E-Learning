*Description*

*Explore and track your learning progress with this interactive E-Learning platform, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code.

This web-based application is designed to help students and developers access educational content and monitor their course progress in real-time. It features a modern, responsive layout and includes embedded video lessons to enhance the learning experience.

The platform displays a list of available courses along with animated progress bars, giving users a visual representation of their completion status. A dedicated progress tracker provides insights into completed and upcoming courses, making it easy to stay on track.

With intuitive navigation and clean design, this project serves as a solid foundation for building more advanced learning management systems*
